<h1>Non-oppressive Commercial Ebooks</h1>
<h2>2013-01-03</h2>

<p>
Although copyright law is too restrictive, it does leave some limited
freedoms for the readers of printed books.  Most commercial ebooks
<a href="/ebooks.pdf">
attack some of those freedoms</a>.
</p>

<p>
There was an ethical seller of ebooks; it was possible to pay cash for
them, anonymously, with no EULA and no DRM.  It was called
SaveTheSciFi.  But it appears no longer to exist.
</p>

<p>
If they can do it, others can do it too.  We just have to make them do
it.
</p>

<p>
This does not substitute for reforming copyright law &mdash; for
instance, to legalize sharing and remix.
