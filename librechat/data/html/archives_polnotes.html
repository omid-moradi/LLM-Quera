captured and tortured</a> by the <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#putinforces">Putin forces</a> for long periods of time.  Some were soldiers, some
have been and are civilians.
<p>
They describe many sorts of excruciating torture, so persistently that it leads me to think that
their guards cannot ever safely be allowed outside prison.
<p>
One person asks why have the International Red Cross and the UN not pressured Putin to treat
prisoners humanely?  I speculate that they know they have no influence, that Putin will defy them as
he defies any influence against his inhumanity.

<p>
Now that heating of the oceans and seas makes hurricanes intensify faster, the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/27/hurricanes-evacuation">question of
whether to evacuate</a> has become more difficult.
<p>
Perhaps new building codes are needed so buildings will be able to stand up to hurricanes.  They
should also include rules to make sure the building won't be inundated.

Wild chimpanzees communicate with hand gestures, and
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/22/chimpanzee-communication-quick-fire-humans-study">respond
to each other sequentially</a> much as humans do with speech.  Some of the gestures have been
understood by scientists.

<p>
Drugs intended to extend human lifespan are developed with
testing on only male mice.  When later tested on female mice, it doesn't function for 75% of
them.  If any do function for humans, they may
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/22/sex-bias-labs-women-losers-research-ageing">treat
only human males</a>.
<p>
The article does not say why researchers normally use only male mice, but I speculate that female
mice are harder to understand because their reproductive cycles make the results more complicated.

he surrendered</a>, so they beat him up and charged him with attempted murder.

For once, the justice system mostly worked: he was acquitted and one

<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bullshitter">The bullshitter's</a> campaign tells the story all wrong, displaying his contempt for the idea of truth.

<p>
I agree: Hezbollah <em>is</em> to blame for this rocket attack, which killed civilians.
<p>
Juxtaposing the US stance toward Hezbollah with its stance toward Israel's attacks in Gaza adds
up to a double standard.  It is quite clear that Israel is failing to carry out its duty to
protect civilians in Gaza, and that is an enormous war crime.
<p>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/harris-support-israel-ironclad-after-attack-golan-heights-2024-07-28/">Harris

<p>
The new UK government said it would stop using a barge
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/23/bibby-stockholm-barge-to-close-after-january-says-home-office">to house asylum seekers</a>.
<p>
This raises two big questions which I do not recall much writing about.
<ol>
<li>
Why the UK's handling of asylum requests takes years.
<li>
Why the barge was such a bad place for asylum seekers to live in.
</ol>
For (1), I suspect the causes include the Tories' desire to discourage people from seeking
asylum in the UK, budget cuts that affect bureaucracy, computerization that replaces human
workers, and an attitude of rigidity among functionaries that leads to delay whenever they
encounter an unusual situation that the rules don't explicitly address.
<p>
For (2) I have seen little concrete coverage of what makes it so bad to live there.  There may
be aspects of its arrangements and policies that make life on board painful, but I have no idea
what they are.
<p>
The one thing I do understand is the barge's remote location and consequent inconvenience of
access.  I think that makes it unfeasible for anyone living there to visit most parts of the UK
without staying away overnight &mdash; and they can't afford to rent a room for that.  I think that
would in most cases cut them off from meeting friends, relatives and support organizations.
<p>
If that is the main problem, could it be solved by mooring the barge in London, convenient to
public transit?
<p>
If there are other major problems of living there, I would like to understand them.

Everyone:

on major news networks</a> to cover project 2025.
<p>
Here's how to make the actionnetwork.org letter campaign linked above
function without running the site's nonfree JavaScript code.
<p>
I have done the first step for you: I added `?nowrapper=true' to the end of the campaign URL
before posting it above.  That should bring you to a page that starts with, "Letter campaigns
will not work without JavaScript!"  They indeed won't work without some manual help, but the
following simple method seems adequate for some of them.
<p>
To start, in the personal information in the box on the right side of the page.  That's how you
say who's sending the letter.
<p>
Then click the "START WRITING" button.  You will get a page that does not function (assuming
you have blocked nonfree JavaScript code), but by editing its URL in the browser's address bar
you can finish sending your letter.
<p>
First, delete everything from `&amp;redirect' to the end.  Then insert, instead of what you
deleted, `&amp;nowrapper=true'.  Then tell the browser to visit that URL.  This should give you a
version of the page that works without JavaScript.  Enter the text for your letter and click on
the "SEND LETTER" button.
<p>
This method seems to work for letter campaigns that send letters to a fixed list of recipients,
the same recipients for every sender.  Editing and revisiting the URL is the only additional
step needed to bypass the nonfree JavaScript code.  I'm sure you'll agree it is a small effort
compared with the benefit of supporting the campaign without opening your computer to unjust
(and potentially malicious) software.

Dr. Mark Perlmutter went to Gaza to do surgery.  He reports being
<a href="https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2024/07/23/israel-children-killed-gaza/">amazed
by the number of children</a> who were killed, and in particular the children who were shot by
snipers.  That proves an Israeli soldier looked at an evident noncombatant who posed no threat
and decided, calmly, to kill per.  Not in the heat of battle, not in the fog of war, but with
unhurried murderous dehumanization.
<p>
Perlmutter reports photographing two dead children who were each shot once in the middle of the
chest and once in the middle of the side of the head.  This makes the unhurried dehumanization
even more clear.
<p>
Some Israeli right-wing extremists post recordings of their hatred for Palestinians.  I think
that others become snipers and commit war crimes.

The history of Republican censorship of teaching history in the US

<p>
Biden subsequently reversed it, but many states have passed similar censorship laws, and the
Republican Party platform calls for one.  Most teachers in the US are now afraid of being
punished for teaching the wrong part of history.
<p>
Learning about the wrongs of history, almost always committed by people other than me, can lead
me to feel discomfort, or even anger, but not on account of <em>my</em> race or sex.  They have
nothing to do with the wrong.  And likewise for you.  As for guilt, I can feel that about
things I myself have done.
<p>
It's the same for you, whoever you are.

As for Governor Kemp, he is not responsible for his ancestors' role in

<p>
Russia effectively took an American journalist hostage by charging him
with unlikely crimes.  There is no reason to believe he was guilty of
anything because Russia did not hold a real trial, which would entail
stating what he allegedly did and presenting evidence to prove it.
<p>
Putin seems to be angling to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/evan-gershkovich-trial-russia-us-prisoner-exchange">exchange him for a real Russian spy,
convicted in a real trial</a>.  Should the US seek to do that?
<p>
I don't think so.  I think other countries should make it clear that
Russia cannot snatch people to use as "get out of jail gratis" cards
for its spies who have been caught.
<p>
Certain governments, including Russia and China, imprison people just
as pawns.  Americans should avoid going to those countries.

<p>
Minister Ben-Gvir, the political leader of the extremist "settlers" that take land in the West
Bank from its Palestinian inhabitants, pushed his way into the al-Aqsa complex in Jerusalem, as

<p>
The dispute over that spot, between Jews and Muslims, exists because
the al-Aqsa Mosque complex was built on the hill where the Hebrew
Second Temple had been destroyed 600 years earlier by Romans
(<em>not</em> by Muslims).  That is true, but it does not justify
Ben-Gvir's bellicosity.
<p>
Peace in the Middle East depends on the various religions' respecting
each others' sacred buildings, especially in Jerusalem.  Al-Aqsa is an
actual sacred building, not merely a place where one existed centuries
ago.  Israelis should leave Al-Aqsa alone.
<p>
If Biden wants to inspire Democrats to vote for him, he could bar
Ben-Gvir from entering the US.

Sanders.  But there is no opportunity to help elect him this year.  A write-in vote, for him or
anyone else, would be a mere protest.  We need to defeat fascism.
<p>
What about third parties?  The Green Party has become too extreme for me.  As for the
self-styled "Libertarians", that name is misleading because their priority is not civil
liberties but empowering the wealthy by eliminating the regulations and government spending
that help and protect the non-rich.  They call those things "socialism".  I call them
"<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#anti">Antisocialists</a>", and I don't support them.

fascism.
<p>
There are still primaries to be held this year.  I urge you to vote for progressive Democrats
in primaries if you have the opportunity, and vote for Democrats in November.

I myself will be happy to vote, once again, for Representative Ayanna Pressley &mdash; but
reelecting one progressive representative will not by itself be sufficient to preserve

They regularly address their followers with blatant encouragement of political violence;
Democrats don't.  Calling a violent fascist a violent fascist does not constitute a call for
violence against per.
<p>
Lindsay Graham claims that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a> can't be a fascist, on the grounds that he has
millions of supporters.  He does have them, but that is beside the point.  It is normal for
fascists to be voted into power.
<p>
Mussolini's party had millions of supporters when he established 
<!---->the fascist dictatorship in
Italy.  Bolsonaro was elected by millions of Brazilian voters, then tried to make it impossible
for voters to remove him.
<p>
What made them fascists is how they changed the system of government once they can.  The
corrupter already tried, in 2020, to overturn the election in which people voted to remove him,
using secret dishonest plots and mob violence.  He also did the usual right-wing lie then,
accusing Democrats of stealing the election he had lost.

If you work for the agency that judges requests for asylum, and you tell would-be immigrants
that "You have been granted asylum", and later
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/15/sheer-torment-home-office-apologises-after-asylum-approvals-retracted">you
discover a minor error</a> in the deciding of the case, what should you do?
<p>
Because of your mistake, you should set aside any minor requirements that you failed to check
before.  Unless <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> is a serious criminal, which you ought to have checked first thing, you
should make your acceptance of per final.
<p>
What you should definitely <em>not</em> do is tell per, "We made a mistake in judging your
asylum request, so we have revoked your asylum.  Cancel all your plans and wait while we judge
the fine details of your case.  We will tell you our real decision in a year or two or three."
That is cruel and inhumane.
<p>
I therefore conclude that the problem in UK asylum approvals is not a mere matter of details in
the rules.  It is a deeper matter than that, a lack of sense of proportion in carrying out the
rules when something has gone awry.  The bureaucrats have been taught to be as rigid as a badly
programmed computer.

Nowadays, the increase in prices for many kinds of things is boosted by the lack of
competition.  The advent of large corporations that own very large amounts of rental housing
has reduced the effective competition on rents.
<p>
I think we should prohibited any private entity from controlling more than a minuscule fraction
of the rental housing market.  (I would not put this maximum as low as 50 units &mdash; perhaps
either 500 units or one local physically connected development, whichever is larger.)

To prevent that, we Americans must vote and work to defeat Republicans at all levels.

That extends to <em>all</em> Republicans.

It used to be that there were Republicans that were right-wing but not radical extremists, who

<p>
Photos from al-Jazeera, confirmed by
<a href="https://www.972mag.com/israeli-soldiers-gaza-firing-regulations/">Israeli soldiers'
testimony</a>, show that it is not unusual for them to shoot unarmed Palestinians for no
military reason.
<blockquote>
The article linked to above contains links to YouTube.  For your freedom and privacy, modify
them to point to <strong>invidio.us</strong> to watch them.
</blockquote>
Further, the Israeli army has very lax rules of engagement.  Soldiers are welcome to shoot
&mdash; whether at a tree or at a human being &mdash; whenever they feel like it.
<p>
HAMAS fighters do not wear uniforms.  So it is indeed not possible to be entirely certain that
an adult Palestinian man walking 100 meters away is not a fighter.  But usually it is possible
to be see that that man is not a threat to anyone at present.  The small chance that he is a
HAMAS fighter does not justify killing someone who is probably a civilian.  Let alone someone
who is surely a civilian; but some soldiers kill even in those circumstances.
<p>
The lawful, and moral, thing to do is to fire a warning shot to tell him to go away.  But the
Israeli army does not order soldiers to do that.
<p>
Although I am not expert enough to state this as a certainty, from what I know I think that
these policies of the Israeli army amount to war crimes for which the highest officers and
officials are responsible.
<p>
Soldiers are also sometimes ordered to burn down or destroy any and all Palestinian houses they
have been using temporarily, citing various irrational justifications.  For instance, they must
make sure not to leave any ammunition or food that Palestinians (presumed to be "terrorists")
might use.
<p>
Destroying food so to make sure that starving Palestinians do not eat it???  Denying food to
the civilians to ensure there is none for the fighters???  That is systemic inhumanity.

The trial of Just Stop Oil activists was meant to keep the jurors in the dark about what was at
stake.  The defendants repeatedly violated the judge's orders to

<p>
I am very disappointed with them.  They had the opportunity to help save civilization and chose
instead to facilitate its destruction.
<p>
But the defendants' effort was not wasted.  The UN rapporteur for
environmental defenders was there, and his report on the trial
was quite stern.

Biden criticized the "elite" for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/11/biden-step-down-rich-donors">pressuring him to step aside from

<p>
Robert Reich says that <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/theres-only-one-relevant-question">Biden answered well in his latest
press conference</a>, except for momentary verbal slips.
Everyone makes momentary slips, and they don't generally alter
real decisions, so they don't constitute real failings.
<p>
I think that if all US voters understood this point, it
would be better if the Democrats stick with Biden.
<p>
But, as we know, they don't all understand that.  Many overestimate
the significance of verbal slips.  Perhaps, as a consequence, someone
else might be more able than Biden to defeat <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#corrupter">the corrupter</a>.  If so,
maybe the Democratic Party would do well to switch to that other.
<p>
If Democrats want to try to judge carefully whether to switch to some
other candidate, and induce Biden to cooperate, I suggest the
following procedure.
<ol>
<li>
Press Biden to agree that he will step aside <em>if</em> the
procedure below is followed and chooses someone other than him.
<li>
Press all the delegates and superdelegates to agree to formally
implement the choice that would be made as follows.
<li>
The delegates and superdelegates -- those who would vote in the
convention -- join in anonymous virtual votes to choose a candidate.
It might follow the sequence that the convention would follow.
<li>
If the choice is not Biden, he carries out his commitment to step aside,
and they officially select the candidate.

many competitors for each purchase -- but only if efforts to pressure

much to fit in the world's carbon budget</a>.  Extracting all that fossil fuel, without some
surprise development, would doom civilization.  The discovery of additional fossil resources in
Guyana makes that excess even bigger; it stimulates the pressure from short-sighted businesses
and politicians to burn too much.  (We do not know precisely how much is too much, and when we
do fall over the climate cliff, it will take years to ascertain that fact.)
<p>
A big increase in the total extraction rate of fossil fuels pushes the world further into the
rush to disaster, adding to the cuts in extraction rate that the world needs to do elsewhere,
which the world is already failing to do.  Whether that increase happens in Guyana, the US, or
some other country, the effect is the same.

The company "Finite Carbon" sells "carbon offsets" based on trees that will be spared the As.
Experts using satellite photos say that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/11/finite-carbon-forest-offsets-analysis">these offsets do little good</a>
for the climate.
<p>
Of course, it is not unusual for businesses to cheat their customers or the public.  Some of
these offsets are fraudulent &mdash; selling a commitment not to cut down trees

won't be cut down anyway</a>.
<p>
Bu what I noticed about these "offsets" is that they can be bogus even by accident.  The trees
in question could be killed, five or ten or twenty years later, by a wildfire, a disease or
parasite, or desertification.

<p>
Proposing that the way the internet promotes social conflict is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jul/07/naomi-alderman-interview-radio-4-series">through
replacement of reciprocal communication (conversation)</a> with one-to-many communication.
<p>
In the age of the printing press, and of broadcast radio and TV, only a few could communicate
their ideas through those; for everyone else, conversation was their only opportunity.
<p>
I am skeptical of her claim that printing, which was a change in a similar direction, brought
about the religious wars in Europe, because such wars had gone on since centuries before.  I
recall two previous series of religious wars, that against the Bogomils (Gnostics) starting
around 1200 and against the Hussites starting around 1400.  In all three cases, it was the
official church against another kind of Christianity.
<p>
The Bogomils used hand-copied books to spread their ideas, and I suppose the Hussites did too.
(This information comes from Wikipedia.)
<p>
I think that the blame for those wars falls on the idea that one doctrine is official, and any
other variant is to be stamped out "by any means necessary."  It was the Roman Empire, in the
4th century, which imposed this.
<p>
That doesn't imply her idea is valueless as regards the internet.

<p>
The change might be good or bad -- the article gives few details.
Tories changed these rules to make it particularly easy to block

<p>
Under the Tory government, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-nov-feb.html#19_January_2023_(Right-wing_deregulation)">regulations for construction were

Enforcement of safety regulations is not precisely the same issue as

Information about opposition to slavery
<a href="https://www.gregpalast.com/jefferson-the-abolitionist/">in the pre-revolutionary
colonies</a> that later formed the United States.
<p>
Some comments from me about this.
 <ul><li>
Condemnation of slavery by workers afraid of competition from slaves
is not the same thing as moral condemnation of slavery as an injustice.
 <li>
Free workers concerned about unfair competition from unpaid slaves can make a difference in
the decision about whether to allow slavery.  We can hope that it will do so.  that includes
the case of convicts who are compelled nowadays to work in prison for wages so low that that
undercut and reduce the wages of free workers.
 <li>
The existence in the British colonies of a minority who opposed slavery on moral grounds
is interesting, but they may have been too few to be seen as anything but a fringe group.  It
is not impossible to end an injustice that is deeply embedded in society, but it may take a
struggle.

that.  It rejected Communism, but advocated an increased level of Socialism.  Now Starmer
thinks to drag them along for lack of a better alternative.

<p>
The article tries to spread Maduro's deserved condemnation on his predecessor, the late
President ChÃ¡vez.  That is unjust: ChÃ¡vez was popular.  He was reelected honestly, after the
people had defeated a coup attempt arranged by the US.  He gave Venezuela more socialism but
did not eliminate capitalist business or democracy.
<p>
Maduro, by contrast, is not honest and has not done good for the people.  He inspired strong
opposition, which he overcame by undermining democracy.  But his opposition (including coup
leader Guaido, backed by the US) has not deserved support either.  It showed signs of working
to restore the pre-ChÃ¡vez <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#plutocratist">plutocratist</a> authoritarianism.

The Democratic Party set its convention for August 19-22, but Ohio's

vote on the candidate</a>, who had already been chosen by primaries.

A week ago, that seemed to be a painless plan.  But now that some
consider replacing Biden (if he steps aside) with some other
candidate, it poses a problem: they can't afford to wait for the
convention to make that decision.  They have to arrange a way to
decide in July.

They are permitted to leave, but it is so isolated that in practice
it is not feasible for them to go anywhere useful to go or where
people they know live.
<p>
This unprison was approved, despite its evident drawbacks, risks and
dangers, because supposedly it would be cheaper, but it ultimately
cost far more than the estimates.  Much like <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jul-oct.html#12_September_2022_(High_costs_of_operating_nuclear_power_plants)">a nuclear power plant</a>.

Ultimately, how did the cost of housing asylum seekers there compare
with the usual cost?  What is the usual cost?

Biden is encouraging somewhat more prosecution of lawbreaking
corporations, but that does not go far enough.  To restrain

How were street dogs treated in Anatolia before the Turkish conquest, when it was part of the
Byzantine Empire?  In other words, was this specifically a Turkish custom or was it an older
Anatolian custom?

How did the many non-Turks in Anatolia in the 19th century, living under Turkish rule, treat

support</a>.*
<p>
Whether the owners are Chinese is a question that there is no need to
ask, because the state should <em>never</em> give money to a business "to
support it."
Instead it should offer to lend money to the company for suitable
repayment, or else buy equity at a fair price.
<p>
These two ways of supporting a company avoid giving the owners an
opportunity to rip off the state -- which the company's owners are likely
to try to do, if they can, regardless of which country they are from.
<p>
With a policy like this, it wouldn't matter which country the
company's owners are from.

A coral reef typically has many species of coral.
I have a suspicion that different species have different rates
of survival.  If the overall rate of survival is 10%, some species
may have 20% survival and some 5% survival, and some 0% survival.
If some species have become locally extinct, that region's coral

<p>
The expensive US pier, meant to provide a way to land aid from ships,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/they-miscalculated-gazas-floating-aid-pier-failing-to-deliver-in-rough-seas">has been mostly a failure</a>.  As of June 23, it had been physically
functional for 12 days out of the 37 days it had been in place.
  This is because the waves on the Gaza coast have been higher than
normal, and the designers did not allow enough safety margin for it.
<p>
On most of those 12 days when the pier itself was usable, there was no
transport to take the aid to the starving civilians.
<p>
The rules of war say that attacking a military target with some
civilians nearby must satisfy the criterion of "proportionality".  If
there are a few HAMAS cops near an aid convoy, who are there to keep
security for the convoy, attacking them and endangering the more
numerous] civilians handling the aid (and this ought to count those
whose lives depend on its arrival) cannot satisfy that criterion.
To attack the convoy would be a war crime.
<p>
If Israel did attack the convoy, that would be interference with
delivery of US humanitarian aid.  Under US law the US would have to
suspend weapons deliveries to Israel.
<p>
The US thus has plenty of leverage to make Israel stop blocking this
aid, but does not use it.

<p>
Julian Assange has accepted a plea bargain according to which he will be sentenced to the time
he has already spent in Belmarch prison.  (One charge has been filed already by the US for him
to plead guilty to.)  He is now supposed to go to the Mariana Islands (near Guam) to plead
guilty and be
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/assange-plea-deal-wikileaks-justice-department-d329ba4614dbfa77b5eb968d07fd9bd0">sentenced
to "time served"</a>, and then leave for Australia.
<p>
Reportedly
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/06/24/julian-assange-plea-deal-biden/">Australia's
support for Assange</a> played a major part in convincing the US to agree to this deal.
<p>
I am very glad for Assange for being out of prison, but I am alarmed that the danger of being
treated similarly will face other journalists and publishers in the future.  If the US had
prosecuted the perpetrators of the actions in the "collateral murder" video, none of this would
have been necessary.
<p>
The plea deal requires approval from the judge.  I wonder what will happen to Assange if the
judge declines to accept the deal.  Could he be sent to a US prison to await trial?

Five years of cancellation have helped me develop a "feelings police" of a sort.  It does not
blank out feelings of danger, loss and suffering, but enables me to set them aside in order to
deal with the situation in a calm and steady way.

have used</a> the "very legitimate grievance" the public has with large tech companies like Meta
about data collection and surveillance as a pretext to undermine user privacy*.
<p>
The first step in protecting our privacy from snooping dis-services is to reject nonfree
(non-libre) clients and apps.  Nearly all apps are nonfree, and most organizations' web sites
run nonfree software in the users' browser.  Once they send private data to the server, there is
hardly any limit in practice to where it will go.  (There are some dis-services that explicit
demand users enter sensitive private data &mdash; those pose various more complex problems.)
<p>
I've considered using Signal, since the client program (what I would need to run) is free
software.  However, it requires having a portable phone,
<!-- [pol note or article if there is any.  Look for something on gnu.org too] --> and that

Rescue Four Hostages</a> in Gaza*.
<p>
Since the plans were designed to minimize civilian casualties, I don't see anything wrong in
that part of the operation.  <a href="#14_June_2024_(Hostage_rescue_carnage,_Gaza)">Many
civilians were killed</a> and wounded after something went wrong during the getaway phase.  At
that point they started to improvise as the plan was no longer usable.

The US insists that Israel did not use the US aid pier for the deadly
hostage rescue operation.  What Israel did use was
<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/us-denies-israeli-forces-used-gaza-aid-pier-during-nuseirat-operation">the
area of land near the pier</a>.
<p>
This makes sense to me.  I don't think that area of land is or was under US control.  But I have
seen it described as a "safe area", which I think implies some sort of agreement to do no
fighting there.
<p>
If that agreement included Israel and HAMAS, then using it for a combat operation (such as the
hostage rescue operation) was a violation of that agreement by Israel;
<p>
I've read that the World Food Program stopped transporting aid from the pier because of this.
This makes sense.  No humanitarian organization will be allowed to continue operations in Gaza
unless it satisfies all parties that it is militarily neutral.

<p>
Many years ago

condemned this</a> and <a href="/there-ought-to-be-a-law.html#no-sports-subsidy">proposed a federal law</a>
to regulate such backwards competition.  The idea
was that if a company makes location A compete against location B, any subsidy from A must get
B's approval and vice versa.
<p>
For the specific case of sports teams, a law outright prohibiting all governmental subsidy to
them might do the job well, but the proposal above would help also in situations which are not
cartels and which do work that is more important than artificial contests.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/19/states-that-do-not-honor-juneteenth">Ten
US states</a> have state holidays that celebrate the Confederacy.  They include nearly all the
states that formed the Confederacy in 1861 and fought to perpetuate slavery, plus one (Kentucky)
in which the unionists triumphed then and prevented secession.
<p>
It is a mistake to take one negative moral judgment of a person as erasing all good that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a>
did.  We should judge a person by the magnitudes of the good and the bad.
<p>
Any individual who owned slaves or supported the Confederacy did wrong that way, but each such
individual did other things too.  In most cases those other things were of no special
importance, so they don't change our conclusions.  But there are exceptions.  In rare cases, a
person's other activities have been such great contributions to humanity as to justify our
admiring that person <em>despite</em> per involvement with slavery (though we should criticize
that anyway).
<p>
A holiday that explicitly celebrates the Confederacy or its leaders is a much simpler moral
subject than a real human being's life.  Such a holiday stands only for the Confederacy and what
that stood for: slavery and bigotry, with disloyalty as sauce.  Those holidays deserve pure and
simple condemnation.
<p>
A few states celebrate a conjoined holiday, "Martin Luther King / Robert E Lee Day".  They
juxtapose commemoration of racism with commemoration of the movement against racism.  I am not
sure what to think of them, but I think they are too soft on slavery.
<p>
It is ironic that the article linked to above displays symbolic bigotry by capitalizing "black"
but not "white".  (To avoid endorsing bigotry, capitalize both words or neither
one.)  <a href="/bigotry.html">I denounce bigotry</a>, and usually I will not link to articles
that practice it, but I make some exceptions.  I think the article linked to above is
interesting enough to justify an exception.  But when I make a such exception, I rebuke the
symbolic bigotry also.

More nuclear weapons than the US has cannot improve deterrence.  With a sane enemy, the use of

enough deterrent.  With an insane enemy, 10,000 nuclear weapons would not be enough.

<a href="https://ajw-origin.potaufeu.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15309830">impossible for blind
customers</a>.  The restaurants have cut staff drastically, so blind customers find no one who
can help them.  They are effectively excluded.
<p>
If the restaurant requires customers to bring a snoop-phone, or to pay using a digital system
that identifies the user, that would exclude me, too.  Even the task of reading the menu can
exclude me &mdash; if I would need to have a snoop-phone to see it, or if it is so high up that
I can't make out the letters.  (My eyes are not as good as they were a couple of years ago.)

The Chinese government made itself ridiculous by doing this, but think about the process that
must have led to it.  The least powerful of those given the duty of going to Australia's
Parliament were surely not of the lowest rank, and some higher official must have ordered them
to do this.  That displays the rigidity of a self-important dictatorship, and the dangerous
hostility latent in its arrogance sense of entitlement to power.

US citizens and residents: call for parole

Pelletier</a>.
<p>
This is an actionnetwork.org "send a letter" campaigns with a single,
fixed destination.  It normally runs nonfree JavaScript code.  Here's
how you can sign it while using LibreJS to block nonfree JavaScript
code from running.
<p> 
The first step, I have done for you.  I added `?nowrapper=true' to the end of the campaign's
URL.  That parameter directs the server not to add unnecessary material that depends on JavaScript.
<p>
Following that link should show you a page that starts with the message, `Letter campaigns will
not work without JavaScript!'  But that message mostly refers to material that `?nowrapper=true'
has suppressed.
<p>
In that page, fill in the personal information in the box on the right side of the page.  That's
how you say who's sending the letter.
<p>
Then click the "START WRITING" button.  You will get a page that does not work at all, but by
editing its URL in the browser's address bar, you can finish sending your letter.
<p>
First, if `&redirect' appears in the address bar, delete that and everything after it, until the
end of the URL you see.  Then, unconditionally, add `&nowrapper=true'.  Then type ENTER to make
the browser access the modified URL.
<p>
This will give you a version of the page that works without JavaScript.  In that page you can
edit the text of your letter, and send it.
<p>
That step, editing the URL and visiting it, is the only additional work needed to sign with
nonfree JavaScript code blocked.  I'm sure you'll agree it is a small effort to stop some
unjust, and potentially malicious, software from running on your computer.
<p>
This method works for letter campaigns that send letters to a fixed destinee, the same destinee
for all senders.  I have posted this campaign, and these instructions, because it is of that
kind.
<p>
Alas, there is no workaround for the letter campaigns that send to "your elected
representatives."  That problem is caused by something outside actionnetwork's control.  The
nonfree JavaScript for those campaigns comes from the officials' own web sites in the official
web sites of Congress, not from actionnetwork.org, and I know of no way to bypass it, and no way
to reach them digitally.  All I can do is phone them.
<p>
It's sad and ironic that our elected representatives require their constituents to run nonfree
software to communicate digitally with them.  I do not hold them personally responsible for this
wrong, because they are surely not aware of the issue.  But I can't close my eyes to its
presence and let it run on my computer.

Using Eventbrite for access to an event is always bad because signing up using Eventbrite
requires running nonfree software.  Also, it requires identifying yourself.  Those are two
injustices to the attendee; I would not attend a performance if it required me to give my name
to get a ticket.
<p>
In this specific situation, the injustices put some attendees in danger, too.  It would not

base to find out who attended this performance.  The performers were aware that China would try
to identify the attendees; they should have protected their audience from digital identification
as well as from cameras.

people identify themselves to buy things is the foundation of repression.

<p>
I think this policy is very wise, but limiting it to only some users, based on their age, is
misguided.  Millions of adults have been sucked into conspiracy theories and even plots for

Robert Reich: for
<a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/its-greedflation-stupid-b3c">most US voters, the
most important issue</a> is the high prices that are caused by greedy corporations without much
competition to restrain them, and most voters think that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a> will push prices down.

I don't think the wrecker will even try to reduce prices.  He seeks to <!-- --> bamboozle the
public, not to serve it.  Promises from a bullshitter are meaningless.  Lately more billionaires
have been giving their support to the wrecker, so they must not think he will reduce <!--  -->
their unparalleled profits.
<p>
So why does anyone believe that <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a> will drive prices down?

<p>
This plan demonstrates a total lack of value for civil liberties, which
<!---->the insurrectionist
has announced his intention to crush.  But this plan makes the party cynical as well, which
previously it was not.
<p>
It is also utterly foolish to think that a promise from

(who is also <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#bullshitter">the bullshitter</a>)
will be kept.  Once democracy is crushed, if you're not a billionaire he won't

<p>
I have contended for years that that party, and its political stance, did not merit the name
"libertarian", because its supporters valued reduction of their taxes, and termination of
programs to help the poor and disadvantaged, more highly than they valued liberty.  So I called
them "<a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#anti">antisocialist</a>".

<p>
Note the typical right-wing thinking, which regards a truthful criticism of a false claim as a
vicious attack that deserves revenge.  If those critics made false claims of their own, revenge
in kind (refuting the false claims) would be possible and legitimate.  But Ms Alito does not
claim that they did so.

The rescue of hostages from Gaza

Testimony of witnesses to the attack on Nuseirat refugee camp, in which
the Israeli
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/06/10/nuseirat-massacre-israel-hostage-rescue-gaza/">army
killed at least 274</a> Palestinians to rescue four hostages.
<p>
The number of killed that were civilians was almost certainly over 100, and likely considerably
more.  But I think I can make a better estimate.
<p>
I think that "children" means minors.  Most minors there were probably civilians, thought some
of the older ones may have been HAMAS fighters.  I would expect that HAMAS, being Islamist,
would not recruit women as fighters (can anyone tell me whether that is true?), so it would
follow that the 57 women killed were all civilians.
<p>
I expect roughly equal numbers of men and women among the civilians, since they were in and
around their homes.  That would suggest there were around 160-170 civilians killed, and maybe
100 HAMAS fighters.
<p>
It is therefore likely that most of the Palestinians in the area were civilians.

<p>
An Israeli military operation rescued four hostages <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/09/israel-gaza-hostages-rescue-eu-outrage">at the cost of
killing 109 Palestinians</a>.
<p>
It is not easy to tell how many of the 109 Palestinians killed were
HAMAS fighters and how many were civilians, but at least dozens were
civilians.
<p>
If HAMAS set up a military base in the middle of civilians, that
violated the rules of war -- in effect, using those civilians as human
shields.
<p>
Or it could be that the place was not full of civilians until they
moved there fleeing Israel's bombing elsewhere in Gaza.  In that case,
Israel would be responsible for driving them into harm's way.
<p>
In either case, their lives do not become worthless because of their
situation.

<p>
Deepfakes displaying politicians and other public figures, clothed
normally, have been
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/08/deepfakes-of-australian-politicians-including-penny-wong-and-katy-gallagher-used-in-investment-scams">used
on Facebook</a> to promote scams.
<p>
I think the crucial issue raised by deepfakes is not nudity.  It is fraud.  False nudity in the
deepfake is one kind of fraud, but the other kinds of fraud are just as bad.  I've called
unauthorized deepfakes the moral equivalent of perjury.
<p>
Thus, rather than criminalizing making nude deepfakes only, I suggest we criminalize making and
showing any sort of deepfake without the subject's permission.
<p>
If you want to show a fictional or satirical picture of a hypothetical action, you can express
the idea just as well with an evidently non-evidential cartoon.

their rejection of the ideals of the United States.

I think that's exactly the point: that <!---->the corrupter seeks to ridicule those ideals by

predecessors did to the last band of Confederate supporters to invade Arizona.

trading that it would provide

for fraud</a> at the expense of Earth's climate.
<p>
The proponents of a "carbon market" tend to assume that such a market would effectively give the
same results as a carbon tax.  They disregard that every trade of emissions quota from A to B is
an opportunity for sleight of hand to hide some emissions somewhere between A and B.

imitating what <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#wrecker">the wrecker</a> tried to do as president.
<p>
Meanwhile, the Democratic leaders of the Senate negotiated a deal for restricting immigration
based on right-wing Republican policies, whereupon the Republicans rejected the deal, calling it
insufficiently harsh.  Trying to make a compromise with Republicans who are obeying the 
wrecker is a fool's errand.

The right to request asylum, and be considered for it according to the facts of your case, is

Republicans are creating irrational outrage over Washington DC's policy of allowing
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/04/washington-dc-non-citizens-voting-primary">non-citizen
residents</a> to vote in local elections.
<p>
The outrage is irrational because those targeted for outrage mostly
don't live there and therefore are not affected by the practice.
<p>
Many places in Europe allow non-citizen residents of a city to vote in local elections.  The
idea shocked me at first, but on further thought I concluded it made sense.  Non-citizen
residents have the same relationship to the city that citizen residents have: they benefit from
local services and support them with taxes.
<p>
Republicans would have us conflate the act of lawfully voting as a non-citizen, when and where
that is authorized, with the act of voting fraudulently.  But the two are completely different.
The latter is extremely unlikely, because what one can personally gain by voting is not enough
to motivate people to break a law.  In fact, individual

Military censorship of news reporting is standard practice in Israel. In Israel's first three
decades, it feared invasion at any time by Arab armies, and was always partly on a war footing.
But that has changed.  In the 21st century, the threat of political embarrassment became the
focus of press censorship.
<p>
In 2011, Israel's

A refugee from one of those countries has a good chance of qualifying for asylum.
<p>
The UK has become incompetent at all sorts of ordinary government transactions.  I don't know
why, but I suspect (1) budget cuts have left insufficient staff to do the job and (2) a desire
to punish asylum seekers and drive them away.  Perhaps also bureaucratic rigidity and
unwillingness to give those staff any responsibility.
<p>
The result of this is that judging an asylum case takes years, so the number of asylum seekers grows and grows.

I sympathize with those farmers, and bailing them out is fair, since they were not themselves to

out that those PFAS make food unhealthful, the main problem will be how and where to grow safe food.

Vitamin A.  Deficiency of vitamin A kills around 100,000 people each year, world wide.
<p>
Any given genetically modified crop may be harmful, or not, depending on its practical
effects, which include whether it is restricts sharing among farmers by means of an
imposed legal monopoly (which could be a patent, or a plant variety monopoly).
<p>
The pesticide-resistant crops that campaigners denounce are harmful in practice, both
because of their restriction of farmers' rights and because the pesticides used on them
are harmful to wildlife and perhaps to humans too.
<p>
Vitamin-A-producing rice do neither of these kinds of harm, so they should be authorized.

defense is an emergency</a> but says the tactics of Just Stop Oil are counterproductive

<p>
That might be true, but since they see that the climate emergency will kill them in a few
decades, what does he suggest that they do instead?  Should they join Just Trust the
Government instead?  Or Just Give Up?
<p>
It is the government's responsibility to be the climate leaders inspiring the people to
more action.  If they demonstrate that following them is more effective than following
Just Give Up, millions will rejoice and follow them.

NYU demands student protesters write confessions for the crime of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/new-york-university-student-protesters">breaking rules with a protest</a>.
<p>
This reminds the author of the imposed self-criticism sessions in China.  It reminds me of
the "apologies" that are demanded of people who are canceled.
<p>
I think it should be possible, by careful use of irony, to cast doubt on university's
proclaimed ethical conclusions while nominally "confessing".
<p>
As for using episodes of The Simpsons to pose ethical questions, I think they are as good
as any other story for the purpose of starting a conversation about ethics.  What makes
the Simpsons so much fun is that it includes irony and doubts its presuppositions.  But
watching The Simpsons may raise real moral issues.

Can anyone tell me whether the contracts students must agree to in order to access the

nonfree JavaScript code from that site?
<p>
If so, I think the kind of ethics being taught here is, "Obey the powerful and the laws they have imposed."

This seems to refer to a German equivalent of the US "RICO" law,
<p>
Ever since I first read about the RICO law, I have worried that it could be used against
democratic protest activities.  The criteria for applying the RICO law are vague and general.
They were written to facilitate using it against secret criminal gangs, but make it hard to
guarantee that annoying protests are not targeted as well.

Their primary goal is to reduce taxes (which mostly benefits the rich), so I call them

Salman Rushdie: *Although he has âargued for a Palestinian state for most of my life

progressive students support such a thing.
<p>
To me, it is disappointing but understandable &mdash; they are yielding to the tendency to
oversimplify situations into "side A vs side B".  If you think about the Gaza war in terms

there is the danger it could be extended to scan for other things, perhaps conversations
about "subversive" topics such as defending human rights or rejecting nonfree software.

US employers are required to protect workers from falls, which can be done with
standard methods.  They are also required to report such incidents to workers'
compensation.  But often
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/23/construction-workers-safety-falls-unions">they
don't do either one</a>, and it is hard to make them.
<p>
The US legal system is generally inadequate for enforcing workers' rights of whatever
kind.  That includes union-related rights, the right to get paid one's wages, as well
as the right to proper safety measures.  If the US enforced workers' rights against
their employers the way it enforces the laws that mainly benefit the rich, American
workers would, practically speaking, have far more rights.

*[Life] insurance companies in Australia are fighting for access to

likely a person is to die</a> from some cancers.
<p>
It is obvious why insurance companies want these data: to charge more to people who
have the harmful gene variants.  The reason that practice is harmful is not so obvious
but it is important: life insurance is presumed as part of the state social safety
net.  If you have dependents, you need life insurance.
<p>
Life insurance was developed back in the day when states hardly had a social safety
net.  In a country with a good enough state system, life insurance becomes
unnecessary.  That is the real fix.

The US left has largely come to define "Zionism" as the political philosophy of

apartheid system</a> that Israel applies to occupied Palestine.
<p>
The danger is that valid condemnation of Israel's actual policies and
behavior may lead to a sort of anti-Zionism, the opposite or reversal
of each aspect of Zionism.  This tends to transform the conflict into
one which admits of no resolution other than the destruction of one of
the two sides.  That would be a horrible mistake.
<p>
I support the existence of Israel, which has the obligation (like every country) to
respect human rights and democracy, <a href="/articles/benevolence.html">alongside a

shortage.</a>
<p>
I see no racism in that statement.  (By the way, Adams is black; for
most political issues that makes no difference, but in regard to
whether his statements express racism it might be pertinent.)
<p>
It is true that only a small fraction of unauthorized immigrants reach
the US by swimming, or by water at all.  His words may have suggested
otherwise; if so, that was inaccurate.  But perhaps he did not intend
that implication.  His words say that many of them say they can swim.
<p>
Anyway, if he was serious rather than sarcastic about the political
suggestion of allowing them to work, I think we can pardon that
inaccurate possible point.

I don't think fire damage to Boston's underground cables is likely.  But in many
places it is another good reason to <em>make a habit of using cash</em>.  You can
make sure that the stores you buy from are accustomed to cash payments and realize
that they will lose business if they don't let you pay that way.

an aid convoy</a>, which was traveling from Jordan to Gaza; its route passed through
occupied Palestinian territory and then Israel.
<p>
The attack took place at a checkpoint where it was going to cross from Palestinian
territory into Israel.  These checkpoints are run by Israeli forces, who evidently
chose not to defend the convoy from the fanatics.  Such noninterference with mob
violence against Arabs is
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2023-mar-jun.html#1_March_2023_(US_Jewish_organizations_condemn_pogrom_carried_out_by_fanatical_Israeli_racists)">quite usual</a>

Some Israelis openly demand to starve Gaza until HAMAS frees all the hostages.  I
don't think that has any chance of success; HAMAS will not yield so that Israel will
forbear to kill thousands of Palestinian hostages.  But if Israel wants to be judged
as morally superior to HAMAS, it <em>must</em> save them.

I am not one of those who claims that it is foolish to have an industrial policy, but
there is always the risk that is used to hide a giveaway to big business.  This one

If the government considers some public employees so essential that they must not go on
strike, the right way to avoid that is by paying the workers better without waiting for a
strike.  Rather than singling them out, it could pay all working people better.

artillery shells for Israel to use in attacking Rafah, and credits this as an achievement
for the protesters.
<p>
His article does not report the fine print of Biden's decision.  Israel surely has lots of
artillery shells already.  Is this decision going to actually hamper Israel's current attack?
<p>
Even if it doesn't do that, it must help convince some of the Israeli government that
Israel cannot continue down this path.  Maybe that will suffice to change the government
and end the bombardment and siege of Gaza.

<p>
As I've noted many times, it is impossible to defeat an underground guerrilla
movement that has the popular support to recruit new members.  HAMAS has that support.
<p>
Israel should recognize this and end the useless and deadly attempt to do the
impossible.  HAMAS is an evil group of terrorists, but there is no use in futile
efforts to eradicate it, and the effort is no excuse for killing thousands of civilians.
<p>
Israel has also announced plans to 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/11/leaflet-families-rafah-israel-assault-gaza-palestinians-biden">attack
central Rafah.</a>
<p>
The "tens of thousands" reported fleeing sound like a small fraction of the people
who have fled to Rafah.  It seems that many must have decided not to leave.
<p>
I can see various reasons a Palestinian might conclude that per chances of survival are
not much better there than in Rafah itself.  So I think only a fraction will go there.  A
substantial fraction will stay in Rafah, where Israel has invented an excuse to define
their lives as forfeit.

It is crucial for public health to find out how many of the people working with infected

cows and dairy workers for this virus.

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/08/iranian-director-sentenced-prison-flogging-mohammad-rasoulof">attracted international attention</a>.
The idea that the festival would drop the showing of the movie if the government
flogs him into saying "Don't show my film!" is offensive.  Film festivals should
disregard whatever the director and other participants are forced to say, and they
should make sure in advance that torturers know that approach is futile.

violent liars when they deal with members of groups they despise, and that the

Discrimination is in general a bad thing.  If in general it gives good
results to cast actors without discriminating between cis and trans,
it is better not to discriminate.

The hard part is judging whether a trans actor can do a good job of
playing a cis role, and likewise whether a cis actor can do a good job
of playing a trans role.  Whether actor A plays role R well is a
question that is inherently subjective -- so how can you tell if you

In 2019, I found that the Tech Model Railroad Club (famously associated with
early computer hackers) was almost dead.  A few years before members had been
vigorously developing it.  I told Professor Sussman, and he told me that several
years before, most incoming MIT freshmen had lost interest in physical hobbies
and activities (model railroading being one).  We both speculated that
widespread use of snoop-phones and antisocial media platforms, which were
addictive to social groups, helped to bring that change about.
<p>
A decrease in Americans' use of those systems might perhaps expand the space for civil society.

<p>
Biden is the most progressive, most liberal president the US has had since 1980.  (I
don't recall enough to judge how he compares with Jimmy Carter.)  We should show our
appreciation for that.  On some important issues, he is doing great.
<p>
At the same time, on some other important issues he falls far short of what the US
and the world needs and what we demand.  We get frustrated and infuriated that he
doesn't change for the better.  One of these issues is ending the bombing and siege of Gaza.
<p>
How should we deal with this half-full, half-empty glass?  I think we should make
sure to keep showing both sides of what we feel.
<p>
We need to keep saying, "Yes, more of that," for the issues where Biden does the
right thing, and "Stop this nonsense!" where he does not.  To continue pressure on
Biden, we need both sides.  Sometimes we need both at once: "This is a big advance,
but without more, we are still headed for disaster.  Tackle the whole problem, fast!"
<p>
There are times for saying, "Yes, this measure is something to be proud of, for
today."  And there are times to say, "Don't make us laugh &mdash; that change is
inadequate."
<p>
The student protests against Biden's inadequate efforts to protect the civilians of
Gaza are running into increasing repression.  Although not violent, they are
calculated to provoke the schools to violence.  This tends to make compromise
impossible and leave no chance of agreeing on an outcome we would really want: It
seems designed to lead to going down fighting, followed by years of hatred, rather
than to a change for the better that leads to opportunities to demand further change.

research</a>, so it will be many years before we know whether we are causing a
disaster this way.

It is possible that some large companies are so inefficient that staff working
32 hours per week could get as much done as they now get done in 40 hours.  But
that can't work for small businesses.
<p>
What could work is to offer employees the flexibility to work

10-hour days</a> in a week.

Students at Columbia University
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/30/new-york-police-columbia-university-student-protests">occupied
a building</a>, and the president brought in cops to arrest them.
<p>
Was the occupation really organized by outside agitators unrelated to Columbia?
I am skeptical of the claim, given that at least 50 students have been
suspended.  That sort of convenient accusation is easy to claim, whether it is
true or not, because it is hard to disprove.  I can't be sure it is false, but I
would not trust Night-Mayor Adams' word for it, or President Shafik's.
<p>
Likewise for the claim that students destroyed doors and so on.
I wonder what the protest organizers have to say about this claim.
<p>
What is unfortunate is that the confrontation has gone in a direction which is
likely to lead university administrations to give priority to "showing who's
boss" over all else.  Which means that the protest movement can vent a lot of
anger but it can't advance the cause of peace in Gaza.  It can only create
festering hostility.
<p>
It also plays into the hands of the right-wingers in Congress who
bullied the university presidents, and <a class=glossary href="/glossary.html#trump">the fascist</a> leader they serve.
<p>
To make effective pressure for peace in Gaza, or more precisely to pressure the
US to pressure Israel to allow peace in Gaza, would require different kind of
protests.

Let's not lose sight of
