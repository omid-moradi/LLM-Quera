<h2 style="text-align: center;">NEVER FORGET YOUR FREEDOM!</h2>

<p align=left>The "free" in "Free Software" refers the "freedom" 
(- a part of human rights, free as in free speech), it is NOT 
related with price which is often misunderstood as "free" 
in "free of charge" (free beer).  Also, the term "Free Software"  
came from  <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Project</a> started in 1984, 
when the term "open sources software" was not invented yet.   Please read
the nice <a href="./ms_oss.html">article</a> by RMS (Dr. Richard M. Stallman) 
covering the difference between Free Software and open sources software.
