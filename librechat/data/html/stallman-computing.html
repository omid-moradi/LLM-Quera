    <h1>How I do my computing</h1>

    <div class="comp">

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        As of 2022 I use a Thinkpad x200 computer, which has a free
        initialization program (Libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.  I've used other Thinkpad models
	that similarly respect users' freedom since the early 2010.

    <p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.  Lemote has not sold such a computer for many years.

    <p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses a
        nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  That was no big problem -- I used an external WiFi
        adaptor.

    <p>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided
        to make their machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear
        to endorse it by visibly carrying it around.  I could have
        continued using it privately with its free software installation,
        but I had no need for another computer to use only privately.

    <p>
        The result that then seemed likely, millions of children running
        Windows on the OLPC, did not occur.  Instead we saw millions of
        children running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a
        using Chromebook that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    <p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    <h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> &mdash;
        namely, those that are entirely free software.

    <p>
        I've chosen not to make judgments comparing the ethical distros on
        practical aspects.  That is a secondary issue for me, and I'd rather
        not distract people from the primary (ethical) issue.  Anyway, many
        others could do practical reviews and comparison better than I can.
        Indeed, I am not in a position to compare free distros on practical
        criteria because I have not tried them all.  To try them would be a
        lot of work, and there are other more useful things for me to work on.

    <p>

    <h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.  The mouse can't make my
	editing commands fail to work by being on the wrong window.

    <p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.  I
        have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my own practical interest in using graphical
        environments is small, I don't want to spend time comparing
        them.  In fact, what I use is MatÃ©.  (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent">accent</a> is used in
        English, with this word as well as some others, to indicate
        a foreign word in which the final "e" is not silent.)

    <p>
        My choice of text terminals is not an ethical issue, just my own
        personal preference.  On the ethical level, I think it is important
        for free software to provide convenient free graphical user
        interface software, which is why the GNU Project launched three
        projects to develop that.  The third one, GNOME, was a success.

    <p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    <p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.

    <p>
        I don't have time to play a game a long time try to get good at it.
	So I rarely play any game except quick forms of solitaire.  Of
	course, any game I run on my computer must not include nonfree
	software.

    <p>
        If the game runs on a server, it must not require any nonfree
	client software, and the server must not be able to identify uses
	or tell where they are located.  It should allow connection via Tor.
        Evidently it must not be a game which you win by fast reaction.

    <h2>How I use the internet</h2>
    <p>
      I am fastidious about what I do on the internet and how.
      The internet has become a disgusting system of tracking people
      and snooping on them.  To avoid this, there are many things I
      refuse to do.  My refusal is not a sacrifice &mdash; on the
      contrary, surrendering to those bad practices would be a
      sacrifice.

    <p>
      I won't connect to the internet in a way that can identify me or
      my location to any company's or government's database, with one
      exception that I don't see a way to get around: at my home, I
      have no way to connect except for my own internet connection.

    <p>
      However anywhere else I connect only in ways that don't report
      who I am.  If I am visiting your home and you let me connect,
      you will know that the person connecting is me; but your ISP
      won't know that.  I also connect in places such as cafes, if
      they have one password that every user uses.  However, if a hotspot
      requires users to identify themselves, I refuse to connect there.
      I wait for another chance.

    <p>
      I generally browse via the Tor network, so that (1) the ISP
      can't identify me and (2) the web sites I connect to can't
      identify me or determine my location.  However, I do not use the
      Tor browser, because I want LibreJS to block nonfree Javascript.
      
    <p>
      I refuse to run nonfree Javascript code sent by web sites.  I
      enable <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">LibreJS</a>
      to block it.  As a consequence, many web sites won't function
      for me.  In particular, I can't access Google Drive URLs.
      I was able to access YouTube via the invidio.us proxies, but
      YouTube is trying to shut that down, so I can't foretell whether
      I will be able to access to YouTube in the future.

    <h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages
        such as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML;
        helpers who know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of
        pages, and the more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer
        helpers install the political notes every day after receiving the
        text of each note from me by email.  A cron job "rolls over" the
        political notes page every two months.  The photo galleries are
        generated
        with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    <p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        also shows why I find the idea loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities so you can see them.

    <h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that specified further transmission via UUCP.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                <br /><br />
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I
                use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a>
                to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running.</a>.

	    <p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.
                That does not violate my privacy.

            <p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but I have no objection to that.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                <br /><br />
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it.

            <p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via
                Tor.  Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to
                them. I think that plus Tor plus LibreJS is enough to
                prevent my browsing from being associated with me. IceCat
                blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            <p>
                I never run nonfree Javascript on my browser, unless
                LibreJS finds it to be trivial.

            <p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because that generally
                requires running nonfree Javascript code in my browser.
                It also requires identifying myself.  I never identify
                myself to buy any product.

	    <p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  That page describes a very few
                exceptions.

            <p>
                For freedom's sake, insist on paying cash.  When a business
		pressures you to pay in an identified way, it's your chance
		to defend freedom by saying, "If you won't take my cash, no
		sale!"

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For searching, I often DuckDuckGo.  Thanks to Tor
                and LibreJS, it does not identify me.

            <p>
	        I used to use searx to search specifically for images,
		but this no longer works: specifying search for images
		now depends on nonfree Javascript code.  Unless and until
		this is fixed, I no longer use searx.

            <p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            <p>
                Since several years ago, I cannot directly access Google search.
                It sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it
                tries to send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            <p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is
                that it depends on nonfree Javascript that it tries to
                run in my computer.  I refuse to let that run.  I am
                not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't
                bypass Tor.

            <p>
                However, the Librex proxies have worked around that
                problem.  They enable me to access Google Search
                indirectly, and they work correctly through Tor with
                LibreJS enabled.

        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="social-networking">I do not use any social networking
                sites</a> because that way of working is inconvenient for me.
                That doesn't mean I think they are all unethical.  Some are,
                some are not. Social networking sites raise their own set of
                ethical issues, completely different from the ethical issues of
                distributing software (<a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
                free vs proprietary</a>), and there are big differences between
                them.

            <p>
                <a name="twitter">I have a Twitter account</a> called
                rmspostcomments, which I use to log in on other sites to post
                comments on articles. I never post on Twitter.  Someone made an
                account stallman_feed which I'm told posts something about my
                political notes. Any other Twitter account that claims to be
                mine is an impostor.

	    <p>
	        I have a Mastodon account, @rms on mastodon.xyz, which
		mirrors the political notes of stallman.org.  The person
		who set up the mirroring chose that site.

            <p>
                Aside from that, any account on a social networking site
                that says it is mine is an impostor.

            <p>
                I do not post on 4chan.  I have nothing against it in the abstract,
                but I am told a lot of the posts nowadays are right-wing bigotry
                which I condemn totally.
                I have occasionally answered questions for interviews for 4chan,
                but I have never posted anything there. Any posting there that
                says it is by me is by an impostor.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have <a name="facebook">never had a Facebook
                account</a>.  Some impostor created a Facebook account
                using my name.  The page is not mine.

            <p id="realname">
                I reject Facebook because it requires each used (i.e., person
                used by Facebook) to have just one account, which means that all
                the person's activities are grouped together.  It also insists
                on knowing the person's usual name, and it is starting to demand
                a series of different photos.

            <p>
                I am proud to identify myself when stating my views; I can
                afford to do that because I am in a fairly safe position.
                There are people who rationally fear reprisals (from
                employers, gangsters, right-wing extremists, left-wing
                conformity enforcers, or the state) if they sign their name
                to their views. For their sake, let's reject any social
                networking site which insists on connecting an account to a
                person's real identity.

            <p>
                Of course, <a href="/facebook.html">Facebook is bad for
                many other reasons as well.</a>

        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>E-mail service</h2>
    <p id="email">
        People sometimes ask me to recommend an email service.
        The two ethical issues for an email service are (1) whether you can use
        it without running any nonfree software (including nonfree Javascript
        code from the site), and (2) whether it respects your privacy.
        <br /><br />
        For issue 1, see <a href="https://www.fsf.org/resources/webmail-systems">
        the FSF's page</a>.
        On issue 2, I have no way to verify that any email
        service is satisfactory.  Therefore, I have no recommendation to
        offer.
        <br /><br />
        However, I can suggest that it may be wise to use an email service
        that is not connected with your search engine.  That way you can be
        almost sure that your email contents don't influence your search
        results.  You shouldn't identify yourself to a search engine in
        any case.



    <h2>Programming languages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="lisp">The most powerful programming language is Lisp.</a>
                If you don't know Lisp (or its variant, Scheme), you don't know
                what it means for a programming language to be powerful and
                elegant. Once you learn Lisp, you will see what is lacking in
                most other languages.

            <p>
                Unlike most languages today, which are focused on defining
                specialized data types, Lisp provides a few data types which are
                general.  Instead of defining specific types, you build
                structures from these types.  Thus, rather than offering a way
                to define a list-of-this type and a list-of-that type, Lisp has
                one type of lists which can hold any sort of data.

            <p>
                Where other languages allow you to define a function to search a
                list-of-this, and sometimes a way to define a generic
                list-search function that you can instantiate for list-of-this,
                Lisp makes it easy to write a function that will search any list
                &mdash; and provides a range of such functions.

            <p>
                In addition, functions and expressions in Lisp are represented
                as data in a way that makes it easy to operate on them.

            <p>
                When you start a Lisp system, it enters a read-eval-print loop.
                Most other languages have nothing comparable to `read',
                nothing comparable to `eval', and nothing comparable to `print'.
                What gaping deficiencies!

            <p>
                I skimmed documentation of Python after people told me it was
                fundamentally similar to Lisp.  My conclusion is that that is
                not so. `read', `eval', and `print' are all missing in Python.

            <p>
                Some fans of Clojure say it is a variant of Lisp.  I disagree,
                because it lacks one of the fundamental features of Lisp:
                cons cells, out of which we construct lists.

        </li>

            <p>
                While I love the power of Lisp, I am not a devotee of
                functional programming.  I see nothing bad about side
                effects and I do not make efforts to avoid them unless
                there is a practical reason.  There is code that is natural
                to write in a functional way, and code that is more natural
                with side effects, and I am not a partisan of either way.
                I limit my campaigning to issues of freedom and justice, such
                as <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">the
                injustice of nonfree software</a>.

            <p>
                Lisp is no harder to understand than other languages.  So if you
                have never learned to program, and you want to start, start with
                Lisp.  If you learn to edit with Emacs, you can learn Lisp by
                writing editing commands for Emacs.  You can use the
                <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html">An Introduction
		to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a> to learn with: it
		is <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">free
		as in freedom</a>, and you
		can <a href="http://shop.fsf.org/category/books">order
		printed copies</a> from the FSF.

            <p>
                You can learn Scheme (and a lot of deep ideas about programming)
                from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by
                Abelson and Sussman.  That book is now free/libre although the
                printed copies do not say so.

            <p>
                My favorite programming languages are Lisp and C.
                However, since around 1992 I have worked mainly on
                free software activism, which means I am too busy to
                do much programming.  Around 2008 I stopped doing
                programming projects.  As a result, I have not had
                time or occasion to learn newer languages such as
                Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Go, Scala, Rust, and so
                on.  Therefore, I don't have an opinion about them as
                languages.

	    <p> If I were not so overloaded with responsibilities and
		work that is important to me, I would study them out of
		curiosity.  But that is not likely to ever happen.

            <p> If you want to learn C, but you already know how to program
                in some other language, I recommend you try
                my <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/c-intro-and-ref/"

		GNU C Language Introduction and Reference Manual</a>.

            <p>
                I read a book about Java, and found it an elegant further
                development from C.  But I have never used it.

            <p>
                I did write some code in Java once, but the code was in C
                and Lisp (I simply happened to be in Java at the time ;-).

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                By contrast, I find C++ quite ugly.<br /><br />
                The flaws of C++, as I recall from when I studied the matter
                around 1990, include syntax and semantics.  As for syntax, its
                grammar is ambiguous, and it is gratuitously incompatible with C,
                which blocks the smooth upgrade path from C to C++.

            <p>
                As for semantics, the abstract object facility of C++ is
                designed around the case where the real type of an object is
                known at compile time.  However, in that case, abstract objects
                are equivalent to a naming convention for functions to call.
                The case where abstract objects add real power to a language is
                when the type is not known until run time.  C++ does handle that,
                but it seems to be an afterthought, a poor relation.

            <p>
                I suspect that I would find plenty of ugliness in the template
                library, but I don't know.  That was added to C++ after I
                studied it.

    <h2>How to learn programming</h2>
    <a name="learnprogramming"></a>
    <p>
        First, read a textbook about programming in some language, then
        manuals for several programming languages <a href="#lisp">including
        Lisp</a>. If they make natural intuitive sense to you, that
        indicates your mind is well-adapted towards programming.

    <p>
        If they don't make intuitive sense to you, I suggest you do
        something other than programming. You might be able to do
        programming to some degree with a struggle, but if you find it
        a struggle you won't be very good at it and you won't enjoy
        it.  What's the point of programming if it is a struggle
        instead of a fascination?  It's your choice -- if your brain
	is better suited to some other activity, you could choose that instead.

    <p>
        After that, you need to read the source code of real programs (or
        parts of them) and figure out what they do.  Then start writing
        changes in them, to add features, or fix bugs if you can find out
        about specific bugs to fix.  Ask some good programmers who are
        familiar with the code of those programs to read and critique your
        changes.

    <p>
        If you fix bugs in a free program that others are developing, the
        developers are likely to be glad to get fixes from you and will
        tell you the way to write them to make them good to install.  Look
        at their TODO list for features they would like to add, and
        implement some.  You will find it is a great satisfaction when the
        developers incorporate your changes.  <br /><br /> Do this over and
        over and you will become good at developing software.

    <p>
        Please use your programming capability only for good, not for evil.
        Don't develop nonfree software, or <a
        href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">
        Service as a Software Substitute</a>.  Design systems not to collect
        personal information, and to allow anonymous use.



    <h2>Non-free software issues</h2>
    <p>
        I firmly refuse to install non-free software or tolerate its
        installed presence on my computer or on computers set up for me.

    <p>
        However, if I am visiting somewhere and the machines available
        nearby happen to contain non-free software, through no doing of
        mine, I don't refuse to touch them.  I will use them briefly for
        tasks such as browsing.  This limited usage doesn't give my assent
        to the software's license, or make me responsible its being present
        in the computer, or make me the possessor of a copy of it, so I
        don't see an ethical obligation to refrain from this.  Of course, I
        explain to the local people why they should migrate the machines to
        free software, but I don't push them hard, because annoying them
        is not the way to convince them.

    <p>
        Likewise, I don't need to worry about what software is in a kiosk,
        pay phone, or ATM that I am using.  I hope its owners migrate them
        to free software, for their sake, but there's no need for me to
        refuse to touch it until then.  (I do consider what those machines
        and their owners might do with my personal data, but that's a
        different issue, which would arise just the same even if they did
        use free software.  My response to that issue is to minimize
        activities which give them any data about me.)

    <p>
        That's my policy about using a machine once in a while.
        If I were to use it for an hour every day, that would no longer
        be "once in a while" &mdash; it would be regular use.
        At that point, I would start to feel the heavy hand of
        any nonfree software in that computer, and feel the duty
        to arrange to use a liberated computer instead.

    <p>
        Likewise, if I were to ask or lead someone to set up a computer for
        me to use, that would make me ethically responsible for its
        software load.  In such a case I insist on using free software
        exclusively, just as if the machine were my own property.

    <p>
        As for microwave ovens and other appliances, if updating software is
        not a normal part of use of the device, then it is not a computer.
        In that case, I think the user need not take cognizance of whether
        the device contains a processor and software, or is built some other
        way.  However, if it has an "update firmware" button, that means
        installing different software is a normal part of use, so it is a
        computer.

    <p>
        Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp, and any nonfree noninteroperable
        communication program, are special cases because of their network
        effect.  Using Skype to talk with someone else who is using Skype
        is encouraging the other to use nonfree software.  Doing so
        regularly is pressuring the other to use nonfree software.  So I
        refuse to use Skype under any circumstances.

    <h2>Streaming medias and DRM issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="streaming">Streaming</a> media dis-services such as
                Netflix and Spotify require nonfree client programs that impose
                digital restrictions mechanisms (<a
                href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/">DRM</a>) intended to stop
                the user from saving a copy of the data being streamed through
                her own computer.  You should never use DRM that you can't break,
                so you should not use these dis-services unless you can break
                their DRM.

            <p>
                An additional injustice of these and other streaming client
                programs is that they impose unjust contracts (EULAs) which
                restrict the user more strictly than copyright law itself.  I do
                not agree to EULAs, period, and I urge you to join me in
                rejecting them.

            <p>
                These streaming dis-services are malicious technology
                designed to make people antisocial.  (If you don't have a
                copy, you can't share copies.)  Rejecting them is of the
                highest ethical priority.

            <p>
                A friend once asked me to watch a video with her that she
                was going to display on her computer using Netflix.  I
                declined, saying that Netflix was such a threat to freedom
                that I could not treat it as anything but an enemy.  I did
                not want to watch anything through Netflix or Spotify even
                on someone else's computer.

            <p>
                Out, out, damned Spotify!  Flick off Netflix!

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Every product with <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org">Digital
                Restrictions Management</a> (DRM) is an attack on your freedom.

            <p>
                Therefore, one should not buy or tolerate any product with DRM
                handcuffs unless one personally possesses the means to break the
                handcuffs.  For instance, don't use encrypted DVDs unless you
                have DeCSS or another comparable free program.  And never use
                a Bluray disk unless you find a way to break its handcuffs.
                Don't use the <a href="/ebooks.pdf"> Amazon Swindle</a>
                or other e-book readers that trample readers' freedoms.
                Don't use music or video streaming "services" that impose DRM.
                (If they require a nonfree client program, it is probably for
                DRM or some sort of surveillance of users.)

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I never used Unix (not even for a minute) until after I decided
                to develop a free replacement for it (<a
                href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">the GNU
                system</a>).  I chose that design to follow because it was
                portable and seemed fairly clean.  I was never a fan of Unix;
                I had some criticisms of it too.  But it was ok overall as a
                model.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In the mid 90s I had bad hand pain, so bad that most of the
                day I could only type with one finger.  The FSF hired
                typists for me part of the day, and part of the day I
                tolerated the pain.  After a few years I found out that the
                pain was due to the hard keys of my keyboard.  I switched
                to a keyboard with lighter key pressure and the problem
                mostly went away.

            <p>
                My problem was not carpal tunnel syndrome: I avoid that by
                keeping my wrists pretty straight as I type.  There are
                several kinds of hand injuries that can be caused by
                repetitive stress; don't assume you have the one you heard
                of.  See a doctor and find out.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I find it bizarre that people now use the term "coding" to mean
                programming.  For decades, we used the word "coding" for the
                work of low-level staff in a business programming team.
                The designer would write a detailed flow chart, then the
                "coders" would write code to implement the flow chart.  This is
                quite different from what we did and do in the hacker
                community -- with us, one person designs the program and writes
                its code as a single activity.  When I developed GNU programs,
                that was programming, but it was definitely not coding.

            <p>
                Since I don't think the recent fad for "coding" is an
                improvement, I have decided not to adopt it.  I don't use the
                term "coding", unless I am talking about a business
                programming team which has coders.
